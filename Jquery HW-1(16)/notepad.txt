1.)More about Event Delegatiion?
Ans: The event delegation helps to simplify event handling by smart use of bubbling.
The algorithm:
--------------
>Bind a handler to the container.
>In the handler: get event.target.
>If necessary, climb up the target.parentNode chain, until either the first suitable target is found (and handle it), or the container (this) is reached.
Use-cases:
----------
>Single handler for similar actions on many children
>Simplifies architecture for different actions, if the action can be figured out from the target.

4.)$(document).ready vs window.onload?
Ans: document.ready is a jQuery event, it runs when the DOM is ready, e.g. all elements are there to be found/used, but not necessarily all content.
window.onload fires later (or at the same time in the worst/failing cases) when images and such are loaded, so if you're using image dimensions for example, you often want to use this instead.

5.) What is $?
Ans:$ sign is used to define/access jQuery.
