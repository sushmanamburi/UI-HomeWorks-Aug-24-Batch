2.) i.)Difference between == & ===?
Ans: == only compares values
    === compares value and type

    Eg: 6=='6' (True)
        6==='6' (false)
    ii.)Difference between != & !==?
    !=  opposite to ==
    !== opposite to ===


3.) Difference between null and undefined?  
Ans:'undefined' means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, 'null' is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
Example:
    var person; 		                            // undefined
    var person = null;  		                    // null

Ans: Already done as a part of Homework 1.
