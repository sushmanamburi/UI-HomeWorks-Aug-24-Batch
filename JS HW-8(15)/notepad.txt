1.) selector.addEventListener(eventType,handlerFunction,captureFlag)
Ans:The document.addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the document.
syntax:
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
The first parameter is the type of the event (like "click" or "mousedown").
The second parameter is the function we want to call when the event occurs.
The third parameter is a boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing. This parameter is optional.

2.)What is Event Propogation?
Ans:Suppose if we have a parent & child element. If you are trying to listen same eventTypeon both elements. If you clicked(event performed) then event propogation will happen.

3.)What is event bubling & capturing?
Ans: Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an element
 inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. The event propagation mode determines 
in which order the elements receive the event.
With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.
Capturing is also called "trickling".

4.)event.stopPropogation?
Ans:Prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases.Incase of bubling, child event handler is only invoked whereas in capturing, parent event handler is only invoked.
Syntax: event.stopPropagation();

5.)event.stopImmediatePropogation?
Ans:The event.stopImmediatePropagation() method stops the rest of the event handlers from being executed.
Syntax: event.stopImmediatePropagation()
