1.) In a directive-scope-(shared,isolated,inherited)?
Ans:scope=shared scope
               -->all directives will share same model which is defined in a template.
               -->this is default one.
    scope=isolated scope
    		   -->every directive instance model would be the independent.
    	Syntax: scope:{}
    scope=inherited scope
                -->Inherited scope is much safer for your parent controllerâ€™s data than no scope
                -->scope: true is useful in situations where the child directive serves the purpose of mutating data on the parent scope.
                -->scope:false, using inherited scope, especially repeatedly, is an architectural smell.

2.) Isolated scope?(@,=,&)
Ans: We have a way to read the attribute values in isolate scope
     scope:{
     attr1:'@', //read a value
     attr2:'=', //read value as model
     attr3:'&', //read value as a function reference
     }
