1.) Why we use Java Script?
Ans: JavaScript: It is a client side scripting language. When applied to an HTML document, it can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was developed by Brendan Eich.

Some of the advantages are:
> Client side validations
> No server burden
> Develop desktop Widgets
> Display Popup and Dialog boxes

2.) What is DOM Manipulation?
Ans: When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model(DOM) of the page. It is a programming interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document. There are so many things involved in DOM manipulation like DOM element creation, insertion, removal, modification, styling, accessing, and relations.

3.)What are the events in a webpage? How can you recognize them?
Ans: Event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. There are a lot of events such as mouse events like onclick, onmouseover,oncontextmenu,..., keyboard events like onkeydown, onkeypress, onkeyup, Frame events, Form events, drag events etc.. Each event has got it's own usage.
We can recognize the event when the 
>Things that should be done every time when a page loads
>Things that should be done when the page is closed
>Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
>Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
etc..

4.) Java Script data Types?
Ans: There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
> Primitive : String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null
> Non-Prmitive / reference : Object, Array

JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic type language. That means you don't need to specify type of the variable because type will get determined automatically while the program is being processed.

Example:
    var length = 13;                                // Number
    var lastName = "varma";                         // String
    var person; 		                            // undefined
    var person = null;  		                    // null
    var y = true;                                   // Boolean

    var course = ["java", ".net", "UI"];            // Array
    var x = {firstName:"Sushma", lastName:"varma"}; // Object

5.) Conditions & Loops
Ans:JavaScript Conditional Statements:
    ===================================
  Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
  >if statement: to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
  >else if statement: to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
  >else statement: to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
  >switch statement: to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.

if..else if..else Syntax:
-------------------------

    if (expression 1){
       Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
    }
    else if (expression 2){
       Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
    }
    else{
       Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true
    }

if..else if..else Example:
--------------------------
 <html>
 <body>
 <script> 
    var class1 = "java";
    if(class1 == "java" ) {
    document.write("<b>Java classes</b>");
    }
    else if(class1 == "UI" ) {
    document.write("<b>UI classes</b>");
    }
    else {
    document.write("<b>.NET classes</b>");
    }
 </script>
 </body>
 </html>


Switch Syntax:
--------------

 switch (expression)
 {
   case condition 1: statement(s)
   break;
   case condition 2: statement(s)
   break;
   ...
   case condition n: statement(s)
   break;
   default: statement(s)
 }

Switch Example:
---------------
 <html>
   <body>
      <script>
            var grade='A';
            document.write("Entering switch block<br>");
            switch (grade)
            {
               case 'A': document.write("Distinction");
               break;
               case 'B': document.write("First Class");
               break;
               case 'C': document.write("Passed");
               break;
               default:  document.write("You r not eligible")
            }
            document.write("Exiting switch block");
      </script>
   </body>
 </html>	
 
JavaScript Loops
=================
 Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

for loop: loops through a block of code a number of times
while loop: It verifies the condition before entering into the loop to see whether the next loop iteration should occur or not
do..while loop: It executes the first iteration without checking the condition, it verifies the condition after finishing each iteration.
for..in loop: It is enhanced for loop

for loop Syntax:
----------------

 for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement){
   Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
 }

for loop Example:
-----------------

 <html>
   <body>
      <script>
            var count;
            for(count = 0; count < 10; count++){
               document.write("Current Count : " + count );
               document.write("<br>");
            }
      </script>
   </body>
 </html>


while loop Syntax:
------------------
 while (expression){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
 }

While Loop Example:
-------------------
 <html>
   <body>
      <script>
            var count = 0;
            while (count < 10)
            {
               document.write("Current Count : " + count + "<br>");
               count++;
            }
      </script>
   </body>
 </html>


do..while loop Syntax:
----------------------

 do{
    Statement(s) to be executed;
 }  while (expression);

do..while loop Example:
-----------------------

  <html>
   <body>
      <script>
            var count = 0;
            do {
               document.write("Current Count : " + count + "<br>");
               count++;
            }
            while (count < 5);
      </script>
      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
   </body>
  </html>
