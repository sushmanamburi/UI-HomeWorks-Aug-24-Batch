2.) Angular JS MVC and MVVM(Data binding)?
Ans: Model View Controller or MVC as it is popularly called, is a software design pattern for developing web applications. A Model View Controller pattern is made up of the following three parts −
Model − It is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.
View − It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
Controller − It is a software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View.

MVVM pattern is relatively new, and it is evolving with applications for mobile devices, but has moved to SPA also.

Data-binding in Angular apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components.
